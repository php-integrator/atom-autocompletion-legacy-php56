## Legacy
This is a legacy version that requires PHP >= 5.6. Users that are on PHP 7.1 can and should use [the newer version](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

This package only exists to cater towards users that are not in any position to upgrade their host PHP version. As a result, any issues that appear in this package will not be fixed, no new features will be added and no enhancements will be done.

## About
This package provides autocompletion for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base-legacy-php56) as well as Atom's [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base-legacy-php56) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Autocompletion for local variable names.
  * Autocompletion for global functions and constants.
  * Autocompletion (snippets) for tag names in docblocks.
  * Autocompletion for class, interface and trait members.
  * Autocompletion for class, interface and trait names as well as their constructors.
  * Automatic adding of use statements when class names are autocompleted (with a somewhat intelligent positioning).
    * Included is a command to sort the current use statements.
